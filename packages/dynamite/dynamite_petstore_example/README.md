# dynamite petstore example

An example showcasing the [dynamite generator](../dynamite) for OpenAPI using the [Swagger Petstore](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore).

Because dynamite does not support dynamic authentication yet a [patch](patch.json) is applied to the specification to make it work. It will be removed once dynamite supports API key and Oauth 2.0 authentication.
